# C-Programming-Drills

Welcome to my C Programming Drills repository! Here, I embark on a journey to sharpen my C programming skills through a series of daily exercises and concepts. Each day is dedicated to practicing different aspects of the C programming language, from the basics to more advanced topics.

## Overview

This project is structured to progressively enhance my understanding and expertise in C programming. Below is a brief overview of the exercises covered each day:

- **Day 1:** Basics (Hello World, Data Types, Arithmetic Operations, Conditionals)
- **Day 2:** Conversions (Distance, Temperature), Simple and Compound Interest, ASCII Values
- **Day 3:** Tax Calculator, String Operations, Multiplication Tables
- **Day 4:** Mathematical Concepts (Perfect Numbers, Permutations, Combinations), Pyramid Patterns
- **Day 5:** Loops and Conditions (LCM, HCF, Factorials), Profit or Loss Analysis

Each folder corresponds to a day and contains exercises that focus on specific topics or challenges. 

## Installation

No installation is required to view the exercises. However, to compile and run these C programs on your machine, ensure you have a C compiler like GCC installed. You can check if GCC is installed by typing the following command in your terminal:

```bash
gcc --version
```
If GCC is not installed, you can install it by following the instructions specific to your operating system. Once installed, you can compile a C program using the following command:

```bash
gcc program_name.c -o program_name
```
And run it with:

```bash
./program_name
```

## Usage
To try out the exercises, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/D-Kumar19/C-Programming-Drills.git
```

Navigate to the specific day's directory you are interested in, and compile the C file you wish to run following the instructions above.

## Contributing
Contributions to this repository are welcome! Whether it's adding new exercises, improving existing ones, or fixing bugs, your help is appreciated. To contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b <branch_name>`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Added some features...'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin <branch_name>`).
5. Open a pull request.
